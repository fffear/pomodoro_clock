###The Odin Project
###Pomodoro Clock Project
For this project, the instructions were to produce a browser app of a time adjustible pomodoro clock.

The most challenging part of this project was programming the display of the timer, which required converting a number to "hh:mm:ss" format. This involved manipulating strings and numbers utilizing arrays.

Another challenging aspect of this project was programming the countdown of the timer. This required programming a decrement of hours and minutes at the value of 60 seconds.

Additional event listeners for button clicks, and an alarm to alert that the countdown for the session or break has reached zero.
